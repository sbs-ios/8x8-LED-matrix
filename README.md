# 8x8-LED-matrix
Arduino Uno code plus an advanced web interface to control an 8 by8 LED matrix without using any shift registers.

What is ths ?
So simply, this project is just an Arduino Uno connected to an 8x8 LED Matrix without using any shift registers, the interesting part about it is the software,  since most of the work went into it 

The software is a web interface that allows to create and design shapes that can be displayed by the LED Matrix, not just that it also allows creating animations by designing them frame by frame using a combination of useful tools that are included in this web interface which was built using HTML CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage
To use this all what you have to do  just copy the code generated by the interface after the desiging is completed and paste it into the Arduino IDE and then inject it to the Arduino UNO  .

I am working on another version of this project that will allow users to control the 8x8 LED Matrix remotely via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in real-time with some extra features.![matrix_connections_s9OJ43nrTc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55545212/120699958-efde5b00-c465-11eb-96de-1e171492dba8.jpg)
